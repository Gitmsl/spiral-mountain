# Spiral-Mountain ALPHA BUILD

Spiral-Mountain is a user-generated videogame news and review site, built with React, Node, Express, and MongoDB.

My inspiration for this site is simple; provide a forum dedicated to user-generated gaming content -- no paychecks or nudges from big game publishers, just normal peoples' genuine takes on the latest game releases. No barriers to entry, no financial motives, just people writing about with their passion as their primary motivator.

Given that the site was only recently fully deployed, I'm in the process of sanding down all the rough edges to ensure full functionality. This was my first go at building a fullstack application, so there have been plenty of learning opportunities while getting everything to function! 

With that said, until the project reaches the Beta stage (see roadmap below), there will be a lot of "test posts" and nonsense to test functionality. If you'd like, feel free to create an account and test out the site's functionality to your heart's content.

I have plans to make major changes to the appearance of the site; a clean mobile site appearance, element sizing and spacing, text-sizing, colors, and hover and click effects are all subject to change. 


## Roadmap

#### Currently in public Alpha
"What does that mean?"

- All functionality is not fullproof: there are a multitude of bugs and flawed/broken processes since the move from running on my local machine to existing publicly on the web 
- Mobile version of the site is not correctly proportioned on-screen
- Visual effects/spacing/sizing are inconsistent or not in an ideal state -- the site is ugly, compared to where I want it to be!

#### When to expect upgrade to Beta
- Most major bugs are squashed, users can
    - Create a new account, or log in with an existing one
    - Edit their account as they see fit
    - Create new posts, update their own posts, and delete their own posts
    - Successfully logout or fully delete their account, and return to the homepage as a read-only guest user
    - Use the application on mobile just as they would on a laptop or desktop, free of visual bugs


#### 1.0 Release?
- This will come when all major functionality is in working order, AND the site is in a clean, presentable state on all screen sizes. Since design and frontend work are areas in which I have more confidence and experience, the time between Beta and 1.0 will likely be shorter than the time between Alpha and Beta.
